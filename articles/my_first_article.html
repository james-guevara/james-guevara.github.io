<p>Interesting article. They split up market participants into 3 groups: savers, gamblers, and sharps.</p>
<p>And there aren't enough savers (who have better alternatives if they want to build wealth) and gamblers (who probably find prediction markets too boring compared to sports and such, and lose interest because of long time horizons) in prediction markets for them to become popular.</p>
<p>Which mostly leaves sharps, but since the predictions markets are small, it doesn't seem worth it.</p>
<p>Also there's this interesting theorem (reminiscent of Aumann's agreement theorem?):</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"This situation, of sharps trading against sharps, is analogous to the no-trade theorem in financial economics. The theorem gives conditions for when no trading will occur in a market. If all traders in a market are rational, and it is common knowledge among all traders that they are all rational, then no trades happen. Existing prices incorporate all previously available information, so in proposing a trade, a trader reveals that they have private knowledge that the other traders donâ€™t have. The other traders surmise that they would lose if they accepted any trade that was offered. So no trades occur."</p>
